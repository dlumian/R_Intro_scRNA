## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R contains several built-in datasets, which are useful for exploring R functionality. 

This notebook will use the iris dataset which contains 150 iris observations of three species.
Each row contains information on Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width and Species.

This notebook assumes you have completed the Intro_R.Rmd notebook and can install R packages. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
```

To start, let's view the data. (Note it is a built-in dataset so it does not need to be loaded).

```{r}
iris
```

Next, let's summarize the data.
```{r}
summary(iris)
```

Let's check how many unique species there are and how many observations for each.
```{r}
unique(iris$Species)
table(iris$Species)
```

We can collect the column names with the colnames function and assign the results to a new variable.
We can then check the type of data stored with `typeof` and the length of items.
```{r}
my_cols = colnames(iris)
my_cols
typeof(my_cols)
length(my_cols)
```

Let's remove Species from our list. 
We can explicitly remove the item with the below code.
```{r}
my_cols = my_cols[my_cols != "Species"]
my_cols
length(my_cols)
```

Create a loop and iterate over the list.
Let's look at how for loops work in R. This loop will print out each column name.
```{r}
for (my_col in my_cols){
  cat('We have a column for: ', my_col, '\n')
}
```

This more advanced loop will print out the column name and mean value.
Note the means should match those obtained by using summarize above,
the purpose of the demo is to see how the loop works. 
```{r}
for (my_col in my_cols){
  col_mean = mean(iris[[my_col]])
  cat('Mean for column ', my_col, 'is: ', col_mean, '\n')
}
```

R also has functionality to gather all the means from a dataset for numerical columns only.
This summarise_if function does just that! 
```{r}
my_means = summarise_if(iris, is.numeric, mean)
my_means
```
#### Visualizations ####
R is also great for visualizations! Let's make a quick bar chart showing the count of each type of flower. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=Species)) + geom_bar()
```
That plot works, but is a bit boring. R gives you a great deal of control to customize plots.
Let's add some color and try it again! 
```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=Species, fill=Species)) + geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('lightblue', 'navy', 'steelblue'))
```
We can also create scatter plots of the data. Let's start by looking at sepal length and width.
```{r}
point1 = ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species))
point1 + geom_point()
```

We can repeat the exercise with petal length and width with minor edits to the code.
```{r}
point1 = ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, color=Species))
point1 + geom_point() 
```

Sometimes, R wants data in a long-format instead of a wide-format. 
We can accomplish this by melting the dataframe.
Notice the melted dataframe has fewer columns but more rows. 
```{r}
iris_melted <- melt(iris, id.vars="Species")
iris_melted
```

With our new melted dataframe, we can create a grouped bar plot to visualize each column
by its species type.
```{r}
bar1 = ggplot(data=iris_melted, aes(x=Species, y=value, fill=variable))
bar1 + geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") 
```
Once again, R give us control over aspects of the graph. Let's alter the colors and replot our data.
```{r}
bar1 = ggplot(data=iris_melted, aes(x=Species, y=value, fill=variable))
bar1 + geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "limegreen", "purple", "thistle"))
```

# Decision Tree Model # 

We will need some additional packages for Machine Learning. 
Remember if you haven't installed the package before, use:
  install.packages("rpart.plot")
  install.packages("yardstick")
  install.packages("caret")
```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(caret)
library(yardstick)
```

## Train-Test Split ##
We will create a train-test split of the data, so that we have data to train the model on
and data to test the performance with.
```{r}
split1<- sample(c(rep(0, 0.7 * nrow(iris)), rep(1, 0.3 * nrow(iris))))
train <- iris[split1 == 0, ]            
test <- iris[split1 == 1, ]
```

Next, we train the model. We are predicting Species from all other columns in the dataset.
```{r}
model <- rpart(Species ~ ., data = train, method = "class")
model
```

We can plot the decisions made by the model.
```{r}
rpart.plot(model)
```

We can also predict with the model on the test dataset. 
```{r}
preds <- predict(model, newdata = test, type = "class")
preds
```

This will append the predictions to the test dataset. 
```{r}
test$preds = preds
```

We will use a confusion matrix to see how our model preforms.
```{r}
confusionMatrix(test$Species, preds)
```

We can plot the confusion matrix for a better visualization of the results. 
```{r}
cm <- conf_mat(test, Species, preds)

autoplot(cm, type = "heatmap") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "steelblue", high = "darkred")
```
